# SortingAlgVisualizer
Visualization of MergeSort, SelectionSort, QuickSort, and BubbleSort written in Java in Processing3 using the G4Pcontrols library

Improvements needed:
1) Documentation and Comments are poorly done, and while variable names are made fairly clear there is a lot of ambiguity
2) Lack of consistency with placement of values in different 2D Arrays (swapping the placement of indices and values)
3) MergeSort and QuickSort currently use a large amount of space and multiple arrays to correctly display their visualization, there has to be a more efficient method.
